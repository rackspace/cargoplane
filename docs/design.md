# Architecture and Design

## Communication Flows

1. **Client to Client:** Web app clients can subscribe and publish to the same topics, allowing direct communications between them.
2. **Cloud to Client:** Your cloud code (ex: Lambdas) can easily publish to topics subscribed to by clients.
3. **Client to Cloud?** Generally, existing mechanisms such as API Gateway are better for this. However, it is possible to subscribe Lambdas to topics.
4. **Cloud to Cloud?** Only use Cargoplane this way if the cloud subscriber is in addition to web clients. For pure cloud to cloud, there are better options available within AWS such as SNS.

## Design

In order to achieve the subscribe, publish, and receive capabilities there are two modules:

- cloud: Lambda to give the correct credentials.
- client: Browser client to send and receive messages.

Here are the steps:

1. Call AWS Lambda to get AWS IoT credentials and endpoint
2. Make MQTT Connection to AWS IoT with credentials

From there, you can:

1. Subscribe to topics and receive messages
2. Publish messages to topics
